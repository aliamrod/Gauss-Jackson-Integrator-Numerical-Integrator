# Gauss-Jackson-Integrator-Numerical-Integrator


The Gauss integration scheme is a very efficient method to perform numerical integration over intervals. If the function to be integrated is a polynomial of an appropriate degree, then the Gauss integration scheme products exact results. 
The Gauss integration scheme has been implemented in almost every finite element analysis software due to its simplicity and computational efficiency.
